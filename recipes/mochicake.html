        <p>This is my favorite mochi cake recipe as it uses only coconut milk to give it an extra coconutty flavor. I hope that you'll enjoy this as much as I do!</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>84 grams unsalted butter, melted and cooled</li>
                <li>453 grams mochiko (sweet rice flour), like Blue Star brand</li>
                <li>2 teaspoons baking powder</li>
                <li>Â½ teaspoon fine sea salt</li>
                <li>4 large eggs</li>
                <li>2 cups/416 grams granulated sugar</li>
                <li>2 (13.5-ounce) cans unsweetened coconut milk</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon pure vanilla extract</li>
            </ul>
        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>    
                Make the mochi: Heat the oven to 350 degrees. Lightly butter a 9-by-13-inch cake pan, then line the bottom and sides with parchment paper.
            </li>

            <li>
                Whisk the mochiko, baking powder and salt in a medium bowl.
            </li> 
            <li>
                Prepare the batter in a stand mixer or in a large bowl with an electric hand mixer or whisk: Whisk the eggs and sugar until pale yellow and thick.
            </li> 
            <li>
                Continue whisking while pouring in the coconut milk, then the butter and vanilla. Continue whisking while gradually adding the mochiko mixture. Whisk until the batter is completely smooth.
            </li>
            <li>
                Pour into the prepared pan, then tap it against the counter to get rid of any air bubbles.
            </li> 
            
            <li>
                Bake until golden brown and crackly, 1 hour 15 minutes to 1 1/2 hours. When you press the center, it should bounce back but not indent at all. Cool completely in the pan on a wire rack. Use the parchment paper to slide the cooled mochi out of the pan.

        </ol>
